### üë©‚ÄçüíªAbout Me:
My name is Lael Bec and I'm a first-year Computer Science student at the University of Victoria. During my first semester of university, I Learned Python, and I am currently learning Java. I thoroughly enjoy the problem-solving that comes with coding, although sometimes frustrating, I find it to be a very rewarding process. Welcome to my showcase of skills and projects, which documents my journey of learning to code, starting with my first ever pieces of code, to my most recent.

### üêç Python Assignments:
- **Assignment 1 (printing, basic calculations)** [view code](assignment1.py)  
  This is my first Python assignment and the first bit of code that I wrote on my own. I created two simple ASCII art characters and printed them, as well as a function to     calculate and print the surface area of a cylinder. 
- **Assignment 2 (doctest, global variables, if/elif/else statements, f-string)** [view code](assignment2.py)  
  My second Python assignment introduced doctest, global constants, if/elif/else statements, and f-strings. I found doctest particularly interesting and useful instead of manually testing each case. 
- **Assignment 3 (return types, testing edge cases)** [view code](assignment3.py)  
  This assignment taught me the difference between returning and printing variables, as well as the importance of testing edge cases. I enjoyed learning return types as I could now call previously written functions and make use of them in my other functions, and I quickly learned the importance of testing edge cases while submitting my assignment.
- **Assignment 4 (for loops)** [view code](assignment4.py)  
  I learned how to implement for loops in this assignment. The function print_rocket_ship was very challenging for me as I had to follow a pattern given to me by my professors. Once I was able to recognize the pattern for different parts of the rocket ship, I was able to see how useful loops are.
- **Assignment 5 (while loops)** [view code](assignment5.py)  
  This assignment focused on condition-driven loops, it took me a while to understand how to write the condition to give the desired output but I was able to get the hang of it. I was asked to code functions to play a dice-rolling game, which I found very challenging but rewarding.
- **Assignment 6 (lists)** [view code](assignment6.py)  
  I was introduced to lists in this assignment, I learned how to append to a list and how to traverse through a list using the lists index. This assignment had me use more while loops, which was good, much-needed practice.
- **Assignment 7 (tuples)** [view code](assignment7.py)  
  This assignment introduced the tuples and how they are different from lists. I learned how to declare tuples at the top of my file, and how to create and work with them.
- **Assignment 8 (read from files)** [view code](assignment8.py)  
  I found this assignment (which introduced reading from a file) very interesting as I felt it allowed for more real-world application than I knew was possible.
- **Assignment 9 (dictionaries)** [view code](assignment9.py)  
  This assignment incorporated dictionaries, which I thoroughly enjoyed as I found them easy for me to comprehend with many useful applications.
- **Assignment 10 (classes)** [view code](assignment10.py)  
  [view race time class](race_time.py) [view race result class](race_result.py)  
  I found this assignment particularly interesting as it featured how to make unique classes and instances, which opened up a whole new realm of possibilities.


### ‚òïÔ∏èJava Assignments:
- **Assignment 1 (java notation)** [view code](A1Exercises.java)  
  This introductory assignment focused on the syntax and notation of writing methods in Java. I learned things like the difference between a list in Python and an array in Java, how to declare variables, etc.
- **Assignment 2 (classes)** [view code](A2Exercises.java) [view fundraiser class](fundraiser.java)  
  I found this assignment not too difficult to complete as I had already seen the concepts in python, it was only a matter of writing using Java syntax.
- **Assignment 3 (nodes, linked lists)** [view code](A3LinkedList.java)  
  This assignment explored nodes and linked list and had me implement various methods such as addFront/Back, removeFront/Back/Middle, and interleave. I found the concept of nodes and linked lists easy to understand, but the tracing to be more challenging.
- **Assignment 4 (stacks, lists, generics)** [view code](A4Exercises.java) [view code](A4Stack.java)
  Similar to the previous assignment, the concept of a stack seemed understandable, but the implementation and tracing took me a little longer to complete. I was introduced to generics in this assignment as the stack class had to be written generically, making it more functional.
- **Assignment 5 (recursion)** [view code](A5Exercises.java) [view code](LinkedSongList.java)
  This assignment continues with generics and introduces recursion. I found the tracing for recursion more challenging but after writing a few methods I was able to make sense of it faster.
