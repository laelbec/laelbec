### üêç Python Assignments:
- **Assignment 1 (printing, basic calculations)** [view code](assignment1.py)  
  This is my first python assignment where I created two simple ASCII art characters and printed them, as well as a function to calculate the surface area of a cylinder.
- **Assignment 2 (doctest, global variables, if/elif/else statements)** [view code](assignment2.py)  
  My second python assignment introduced doctest, global constants, and if/elif/else statements.
- **Assignment 3 (return types, testing edge cases)** [view code](assignment3.py)  
  This assignment taught me the difference between returning and printing variables, as well as the importance of testing edge cases.
- **Assignment 4 (for/while loops)** [view code](assignment4.py)  
  I learned how to implement loops and when to use a for or while loop in this assignment.
- **Assignment 5 (loops cont.)** [view code](assignment5.py)  
  This assignment focused on loops, and had me code functions to play a dice-rolling game, which I found very challenging but rewarding.
- **Assignment 6 (lists)** [view code](assignment6.py)  
  I was introduced to lists in this assignment, I learned how to append to a list and how to traverse through a list using the lists index.
- **Assignment 7 (tuples)** [view code](assignment7.py)  
  This assignment introduced the tuples and how they are different from lists. I learned how to declare tuples at the top of my file, and how to create and work with them.
- **Assignment 8 (read from files)** [view code](assignment8.py)  
  I found this assignment very interesting as I felt it was useful.
- **Assignment 9 (dictionaries)** [view code](assignment9.py)  
  I enjoyed this assignment as I like working with dictionaries, I found them easier for my to comprehend.
- **Assignment 10 (classes)** [view code](assignment10.py)  
  [view race time class](race_time.py) [view race result class](race_result.py)  
  I found this assignment particularly interesting.


### ‚òïÔ∏èJava Assignments:
- **Assignment 1 (java notation)** [view code](A1Exercises.java)
  This introductory assignment focused on the syntax and notation of writing methods in java, arrays
- **Assignment 2 (classes)** [view code](A2Exercises.java)
  [view fundraiser class](fundraiser.java)
- **Assignment 3 (nodes, linked lists)** [view code](A3LinkedList.java)
- **Assignment 4 (stacks, nodes)** [view code](A4Exercises.java) [view code](A4Stack.java)
- **Assignment 5 (recursion)** [view code](A5Exercises.java) [view code](LinkedSongList.java)
