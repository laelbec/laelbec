### 🐍 Python Assignments:
- **Assignment 1 (printing, basic calculations)** [view code](assignment1.py)  
  This is my first python assignment where I created two simple ASCII art characters and printed them, as well as a function to calculate the surface area of a cylinder.
- **Assignment 2 (doctest, global variables, if/elif/else statements)** [view code](assignment2.py)  
  My second python assignment introduced doctest, global constants, and if/elif/else statements.
- **Assignment 3 (return types, testing edge cases)** [view code](assignment3.py)  
  This assignment taught me the difference between returning and printing variables, as well as the importance of testing edge cases
